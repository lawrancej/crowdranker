Crowdsourced grading and ranking of submissions

This is a web2py app that manages submissions to venues, and enables 
participants to crowd-grade the submissions.  A reputation system is used
to produce high-quality rankings of the submissions.  The users are 
evaluated both for the quality of their submissions, and for their 
accuracy in ranking the submissions of other users.
